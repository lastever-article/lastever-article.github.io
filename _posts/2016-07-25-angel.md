在每个人的生命中，总会遇到这么一些人：他们是你最爱的人，是你生命中最珍贵的财富，他们的名字被深深地刻在你的心里，就像你的生命，永远不能忘怀。    

我有两个知己，他们是两个天使落在我的心里。他们用他们自己的魔法将我的世界点缀得鸟语花香。每一泉小溪走过的笑语，被我们称之为幸福。天使一定都拥有甜美的微笑吧，不然为何他们笑的地方都蝶舞蜂集？不然为什么一被他们的微笑渲染就变得快乐无比？天使是幸福的精灵，他们蒲公英的小伞下的地方就是幸福小花盛开的花园。那个地方，被西方人称之为天堂。

我们曾经有过难以统计的幸福种子，每一个种子播种的地方都被我们深深牢记。有他们在身边，黑夜从不因恐惧而难以度过，寂寞从不像乌云常随于心。他们金色的光环照亮了所有阴霾，他们宽广的翅膀让心飞扬。我爱他们，就像爱自己的生命一般，永远永远送上最真的祝福和感念。

但，上天说，两个天使还有别的任务要做，不能一直留在我的身边。我们在晴朗的六月高声话别，就像那晴朗的天气，看着，目送对方离去了。有人说，临毕业时，你最好的朋友总是面带微笑欢送你，然后把眼泪落在心中——是啊，既是天使，怎能让所爱的人见自己流泪？姑且把眼泪化做别离的祝愿，像一粒小小的风信子，跟着渐远的旅行箱，直到将近天边。

两个天使，我想你们了，你们现在都还好吗？南昌那里人生地不熟，可要做个爱护自己的好孩子哦！四川那边考研一定很累吧，要保重身体，千万不要累坏了，你要记得我们的七年之约哦！请你们放心，我在这里很好，每天都很努力地朝自己的目标前进——放心，赤脚的小孩一定不会忘记别离的誓言的，请好好保重……我还想说很多很多，但千言万语莫过于一句话，祝你们一切都好……

In our lives，there are always such people: they are someone you care most about and are the most precious treasure of your life. Their names are deeply engraved in your mind. As important as yourself, they are never to be forgotten.

I have two intimates, who were two angels fallen in my heart. They used their special magic to cover my whole life with delight. We called it happiness that a lovely stream which our smiles went by. I think all angels must have sweet smiles ,for butterflies gathered where they smiled and the first moment when I was infected by their happiness, my world was more than happiness. Angels are fairies of happiness. Where they dropped a little seed of joy, it grows to be a garden of happiness, where the Westerners called the paradise.

We used to have countless seeds of happiness. We kept them in mind where we planted them. With them by my side, the dark were never hard to go through because of fear and loneliness were never like black clouds around me. Their splendid rings lit up all the darkness. And their broad wings let our hearts fly. I love them, as deeply as my own life. I'll give them my best and deepest wishes.

However, the God said, the angels had some other tasks to take so that they'd not stay with me any more. We separated on a fine day of June.Fine as the weather ,we waved goodbye until we saw each other off.It is said that at graduation,your best friend was someone who was crying on the inside bu managed the biggest smile one could give as they congratulated you. That was true. How could an angel let their love see them cry?So let us make the tears a wish for separation on the wind, following the suitcase they were taking to the horizon.

My two angels,I'm missing you.How are you two now?You'er strange to Nanchang ,please care  more about yourself.It must be very tired studying hard in Sichuan, please care more aout your health,never get too tired.You should remember that we'll get together seven years later and I want to see you all right.Don't worry about me,I'm allright here.I work hard every day to get close to my goals.I won't forget my promise on departure,just take care about yourselves for me.I have even more to say but all I want to express can be put into one sentence,I hope everything is going will for you.
